## Brief Overview (Abstract)
Many students have experience building systems without understanding the underlying drivers actuating the device. 
In this project, we explore the process of building device drivers for 95% of system components of a quadcopter drone. 
We achieved higher-level functionality including a flight control algorithm, image capturing mechanism, and manual remote control (RC), 
while following a ground-up approach to interfacing with each peripheral device. 
In developing these drivers, we gained significant experience with several hardware communication protocols such as I2C, UART, SPI, and became deeply familiar with the inner workings of each peripheral device. 
This allowed us to optimize our quadcopter at lower levels than what would be typically achievable using existing libraries, improving on battery life, communication speed, and memory efficiency.
